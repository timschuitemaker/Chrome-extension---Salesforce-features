# Chrome extension - Salesforce features

This chrome extension adds features to a (classic) page layout on SF.
- It adds the current 18 char ID to the page;
- It adds Go to links in the edit page of the object (e.g. Go to selected object in the edit-screen); 

I'm planning to add additional features to this plugin.
